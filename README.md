# Drawing Game

## Overview

In this drawing game, players each write a prompt and then randomly draw a prompt written by someone else. Itâ€™s a fun way to challenge your creativity and see how others interpret your prompts.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   **Node.js** (for frontend)
-   **Go** (for backend)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/drawing-game.git
    cd drawing-game
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

### Usage

#### Environment Setup

1. **Create and Configure `.env` File**

    You need to set up environment variables for the application to work. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the necessary variables:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Then, edit the `.env` file to include your database URL and authentication token:

    ```env
    TURSO_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
    TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token_here
    VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8080
    ```

    You need to create a Turso database and obtain the URL and authentication token from your [Turso account](https://turso.tech/).

2. **Running the Application**

    - To build and run the application without formatting:

        ```bash
        make run
        ```

    - To build, format code, and run:

        ```bash
        make run-with-format
        ```
